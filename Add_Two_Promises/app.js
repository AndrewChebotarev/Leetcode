2723. Add Two Promises

Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers.
 
Example 1:

Input:
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)),
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not judged for this problem.
Example 2:

Input:
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 50)),
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(-12), 30))
Output: -2
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 10 and -12 respectively. The returned promise should resolve with a value of 10 + -12 = -2.
 
Constraints:

promise1 and promise2 are promises that resolve with a number
